MCL	81	Pale Violet Red 3	1	Prkag1	10090.ENSMUSP00000132499	5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1; AMP/ATP-binding subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor protein kinase that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation. AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. Also acts as a  [...] 
MCL	82	Pale Violet Red 2	1	Carm1	10090.ENSMUSP00000034703	Histone-arginine methyltransferase CARM1; Methylates (mono- and asymmetric dimethylation) the guanidino nitrogens of arginyl residues in several proteins involved in DNA packaging, transcription regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA stability. Recruited to promoters upon gene activation together with histone acetyltransferases from EP300/P300 and p160 families, methylates histone H3 at 'Arg-17' (H3R17me), forming mainly asymmetric dimethylarginine (H3R17me2a), leading to activates transcription via chromatin remodeling. During nuclear hormone receptor activation and TCF7L2/TCF4 activ [...] 
MCL	83	Pale Violet Red	1	Stom	10090.ENSMUSP00000028241	Erythrocyte band 7 integral membrane protein; Regulates ion channel activity and transmembrane ion transport. Regulates ASIC2 and ASIC3 channel activity; Belongs to the band 7/mec-2 family
MCL	84	Pink	1	Agpat2	10090.ENSMUSP00000028286	1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase beta; Converts lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) into phosphatidic acid by incorporating an acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone
MCL	85	Light Coral 3	1	Pygb	10090.ENSMUSP00000035743	Glycogen phosphorylase, brain form; Glycogen phosphorylase that regulates glycogen mobilization. Phosphorylase is an important allosteric enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism. Enzymes from different sources differ in their regulatory mechanisms and in their natural substrates. However, all known phosphorylases share catalytic and structural properties
MCL	86	Light Coral	1	Mtor	10090.ENSMUSP00000099510	Serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR; Serine/threonine protein kinase which is a central regulator of cellular metabolism, growth and survival in response to hormones, growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals. MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2). Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis. This includes phosphorylation of EIF [...] 
MCL	87	Light Coral 2	1	Tecr	10090.ENSMUSP00000128329	trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase
